  title: string;
  description: string;
  probability: number;    // 0-100
  impact: number;         // 0-100
}
```

}
```

{
  id: string;
  department: string;
  task: string;
  duration: string;
  status: "pending" | "in-progress" | "completed";
}
```

#### SummaryCardData (for implementation)
```typescript
{
  businessOperationsFlow: {
    summary: string;
    steps: Array<{
      id: string;
      description: string;
      department: string;
    }>;
  };
  departments: Array<{
    id: string;
    department: string;
    manager: string;
    email: string;
    tasks: Array<{
      id: string;
      description: string;
      priority: "high" | "medium" | "low";
      deadline: string; // ISO date format
    }>;
    emailTemplate: {
      to: string;
      recipient: string;
      department: string;
      subject: string;
      body: string;
    };
  }>;
}
```

### Email Templates

A unique feature of this API is that it generates email templates for each department involved in implementing each option. This allows the system to send notifications or prepare implementation communications for any selected option without requiring additional API calls.

Key aspects of the email templates:
1. Each option (A, B, C) has its own set of email templates
2. Templates are organized by department
3. Each template includes:
   - Recipient information (name, email, department)
   - Subject line specific to the implementation task
   - Body text with personalized task descriptions
   - Due dates and priority levels

This design ensures that regardless of which option is selected for implementation, the system immediately has access to all the communication templates needed to begin the implementation process.

## Implementation Notes

1. The API is implemented as a Next.js API route at `src/app/api/optimization/route.ts`
2. In a production environment, this API would:
   - Connect to AI services for analyzing the user query
   - Retrieve real-time business data from databases
   - Generate custom optimization options based on the specific query
   - Use machine learning models for projections and impact analysis
   - Create detailed implementation plans with department tasks and email templates
3. The current implementation uses static mock data to demonstrate the structure

## API Types

The TypeScript interfaces for these API types are defined in `src/lib/api.ts` and can be imported and used throughout the application for type safety.
