The problem: Mismatch json format of expected json format aat front-end and the actual response from back-end. The rest of jSON is find, its just the alternative options flow is faulty.


At the end of the file i will give the example of current json response from backend.

Analysis on current json from backend:

 I can see that the alternative options (A, B, and C) do not have the same detailed nodes and edges structure as the main business flow.
While the main businessFlow section contains a complete visualization structure with:
json"businessFlow": {
  "nodes": [
    {"id": "node-1", "label": "Process Start", "type": "start", "position": {"x": 50, "y": 100}},
    ...
  ],
  "edges": [
    {"id": "edge-1", "source": "node-1", "target": "node-2", "label": "Input"},
    ...
  ]
}
The option-specific flows in the summaryCard section have a much simpler structure:
json"businessOperationsFlow": {
  "summary": "Implement comprehensive training and development programs...",
  "steps": [
    {"id": "step-B-1", "description": "solving, communication, and product knowledge.", "department": "Customer Service"},
    ...
  ]
}
This shows that:

The main businessFlow has a complete graph visualization structure with nodes, edges, positions, and types
The option-specific businessOperationsFlow has only a linear sequence of steps with descriptions and departments

The recommendation options themselves do contain implementationPlan arrays, but these are also simple lists of tasks rather than interconnected nodes and edges.

the alternative options do not have the same detailed nodes and edges structure as the main business operations flow visualization. They use a simplified, linear step structure instead.


Aspiration:
f the alternative options did have detailed nodes and edges like the main business flow, the JSON structure would look something like this:
json"recommendations": {

This structure would mirror the format of the main businessFlow section but would be specific to each option, showing:

A unique set of nodes with:

IDs prefixed with the option identifier (e.g., "node-A-1", "node-B-1")
Labels describing the steps in that particular approach
Position coordinates for visualization
Type and status information


A unique set of edges that:

Connect the nodes in sequence
Have descriptive labels for the transitions
Include flowType to indicate optimization level


Each option would have its own complete, standalone process flow visualization

This would allow the front-end to render a different process flow diagram for each alternative option, enabling users to visually compare the different approaches.
