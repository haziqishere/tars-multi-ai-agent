Your task is to create three strategic branches representing different implementation approaches:
- Branch A: Conservative approach (lower risk, lower reward)
- Branch B: Balanced approach (moderate risk, moderate reward)
- Branch C: Aggressive approach (higher risk, higher reward)

For each branch, provide:
1. A concise one-line summary of the approach
2. 2-3 pros (benefits)
3. 2-3 cons (drawbacks)
4. Estimated cost in USD (realistic figure)
5. Estimated implementation time in months
6. Overall score (1-10)
7. 3-5 specific action items

Finally, recommend which branch (A, B, or C) would be the optimal approach based on the context provided.

Format your response as follows:

A Strategic Branch A: [Summary]
Pros:
- [Pros]
Cons:
- [Cons]
CostUSD: [cost]
