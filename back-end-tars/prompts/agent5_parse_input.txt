You are helping to extract key action information from a strategic analysis.

INPUT:
{raw_input}

Your task is to identify:
1. The main strategic action/approach being recommended
2. Specific action items that need to be implemented

Extract this information and format it as a JSON object with the following structure:
```json
{
  "action": "Brief summary of the main strategic approach (1 sentence)",
  "action_items": [
    "First specific action item to implement",
    "Second specific action item to implement",
    "Additional action items as needed"
  ]
}
```

Guidelines:
- The "action" should be a concise summary (no more than 15 words)
- The "action_items" should be concrete, implementable tasks
- Extract 3-7 action items from the text
- Keep each action item short and focused (10-15 words)
- Focus on items that would need to be assigned to departments

Respond with ONLY the JSON object, no additional text or explanation.
