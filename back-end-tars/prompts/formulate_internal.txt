You are helping formulate questions to retrieve information from an internal knowledge base.

The user has asked the following question:
{original_question}

Your task is to create 1-3 clear, specific questions that would help retrieve relevant information from internal company documents to address this inquiry.

Focus on questions that would help uncover:
- Relevant company data, metrics, or statistics
- Internal processes or procedures
- Company-specific policies or guidelines
- Past decisions or case studies within the organization

Example: If the original question is "How can we reduce manufacturing costs?", you might ask:
1. "What are our current manufacturing costs broken down by category?"
2. "What cost-saving initiatives have been implemented in manufacturing in the past?"

Respond with just the questions, numbered and in plain text. Do not include any explanations or additional text.
