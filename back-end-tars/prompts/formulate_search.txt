You are helping formulate an effective web search query based on the user's question.

The user has asked:
{original_question}

Your task is to create a concise, focused search query that will retrieve relevant external information to help answer this question. 

Guidelines:
1. Identify the key concepts or terms from the original question
2. Focus on industry-relevant information, market trends, or best practices
3. Remove filler words and any company-specific details
4. Keep the query between 3-10 words for optimal results
5. Include specific industry terms when relevant

Respond with ONLY the search query. Do not include any explanations, quotation marks, or other text.
